So to setup you create a folder, then you create a src folder inside of it

then the root folder you have to specify it in the path the way you do this is
through the following:

echo "export $GOPATH=<path>" >> ~/.bash_profile;

then you create folders in the src folder and bamm you have your enviroment setup

in order to run your Go app you use `go run app.go`


If you want to create an executable, what you need to do is run

go build app.go

./app.go
